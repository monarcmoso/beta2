	AVALON &reg; American Ginseng Slice, replenish your energy! Why do we need American Ginseng? Our hectic lifestyle results in us being highly stressed, always over-exerting ourselves and suffering from a lack of sleep. We often feel tired, lack of strength and sleepy throughout the day. Other common symptoms include irritable and hepato-pyrexia. In addition, hot weather results in dryness in the mouth, profuse sweating, sleeplessness, lack of energy, etc. The above symptoms are regarded as &ldquo; Qi and Yin deficiencies&rdquo; in TCM. Such deficiencies over a long period will deplete our Qi (Energy) and may result in illnesses. &nbsp; Perpetual state of fatigue disrupts our metabolism and body functions. At this stage, our internal system will not recover fully by simply one or two resting. Appropriate nourishing is necessary to reverse harms caused to our body, effectively cure &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo;, replenish energy and return our body to its equilibrium. Ginseng, a good Adaptogen American ginseng, or Panax quinquefolius, originated from the US and Canada , is a highly valuable healthcare supplement and has been used clinically for more than 300 years. Ginseng&#39;s genus name Panax is derived from the Greek pan (all) akos (cure), meaning cure-all. The transliteration of the word gin (man) seng (essence) is derived from the Chinese ideogram for &quot;crystallization of the essence of the earth in the form of a man&rdquo;. &nbsp; TCM believes that American and Asian ginsengs replenish Qi, however American ginseng has a cooling property, whereas Asian ginseng may cause heatiness. &nbsp; American ginseng is often used to replenish energy ( Qi ), relief stress, improve concentration, and heighten both physical and intellectual powers. In the West, American ginseng is regarded as an excellent adaptogen to help people to adapt to the environment, reinstate body equilibrium, restore energy and improve body&#39;s resistance to stress and illnesses. Native Americans use ginseng to enhance fertility and improve mental faculty, as well as treat respiratory illnesses, headache and fever. &nbsp; Medical researches confirm that the cooling American ginseng not only replenishes energy (Qi), nourish Yin, improves alertness and memory, relieves fatigue and nourishes the lungs, it also promotes body fluid production, maintains youthful looks, restores equilibrium and strengthens immune system. With so many benefits, it is indeed a first class tonic. &nbsp; When do we need American Ginseng? &bull;&nbsp; prior intense mental work &bull;&nbsp; before and after exercise &bull;&nbsp; traveling &bull;&nbsp; lack of strength &bull;&nbsp; learning, examinations, feeling tense &bull;&nbsp; chest tightness, asthma, cough &bull;&nbsp; dryness in the mouth, irritable and sleeplessness &bull;&nbsp; general weakness, lack of energy &bull;&nbsp; post surgery, post delivery, and recovering from an illness &nbsp; Rejuvenate your life AVALON &reg; American Ginseng Slice with Honey is a convenient and nourishing product launched by Hi-Beau International Pte Ltd. This product uses premium grade American ginseng and linden honey, thereby is extremely palatable. It helps boost stamina and vigor without heating and stimulating properties. For hygiene, portability and easy consumption, AVALON &reg; American Ginseng Slice with Honey is vacuum-packed in sachets. As each sachet contains 5g of honey Ginseng, dosage is well controlled. The nutritive benefits of Essence of Ginseng are optimized by immediate absorption through the capillaries in the mouth during the chewing process. &nbsp; The benefits of AVALON &reg; American Ginseng Slice with Honey &bull;&nbsp; Enhances immunity &bull;&nbsp; Replenish energy &bull;&nbsp; Relief fatigue &bull;&nbsp; Nourishes lungs to safeguard against cough &bull;&nbsp; Prevents dryness of mouth and constant thirst &bull;&nbsp; Promotes beauty and maintain youthful looks &bull;&nbsp; Improve concentration and memory &nbsp; Recommended Dosage For general healthcare, consume a sachet daily, by chewing. &nbsp; Feeling fatigue, before and during cold, post operation, post delivery and recovering from illness, consume 2 packs daily, by chewing. &nbsp; Tips on taking ginseng Tip # 1 : Do not over-consume Ginseng at any one time. Over dosage can result in side effects such as nose-bleeding, nervousness, skin eruptions, stomach upset. Though ginseng is good for health, please do not over eat! AVALON&reg; American Ginseng Slice with Honey is vacuum packed in 5g of honey ginseng. Take one sachet each time to maintain consistency of dosage and avoid over-dosage.

Though ginseng is highly nutritional, we still need to consume it at the right time. AVALON&reg; American Ginseng Slice with Honey is ready for consumption at your convenience. However avoid consuming with an empty stomach even for healthy people. Tip # 3 : Not many people bother to spend time and energy to prepare ginseng tonic soup regularly. No matter how nutritious a tonic product is, regular consumption is necessary to enjoy its maximum benefits. Ginseng is an excellent tonic, but the preparation is extremely time-consuming! AVALON&reg; American Ginseng Slice with Honey is vacuum packed, hygienic and ready-to-eat. All you need is just a sachet per day. Tip #4 : Asian ginseng (Chinese and Korean ginseng) is not suitable for everyone. It can be too heaty for some people.

	New ingredient for more powerful anti-ageing Adenosine Tri-phosphate (ATP) is a molecule which stores the energy that the body needs for a wide variety of functions. The breakdown of ATP releases energy which is then used as fuel for all our bodily functions, from DNA replication and skin regeneration to muscle contraction and collagen synthesis. Bio-essence V Face Series, enriched with ATP and combination of exclusive ingredients Bio Energy Fluid and Bio Mineral Essence, have double the effects to provide and communicate energy to skin cells. ATP improves micro-circulation, effectively renewing and repairing skin, hence restores suppleness, radiance, firmness and a youthful V shape to your skin. Removing dead skin is the first step to beautiful, healthy and younger looking skin. The accumulation of dead skin leads to multiple skin care problems; dead skin can clog pores, causing enlarged pores, blackheads and whiteheads. It also prevents the skin from absorbing moisture leading to dull, rough and oily skin. Bio-essence Deep Exfoliating Gel with ATP helps to slough off dead skin cells immediately to reveal a new layer of fairer, smoother and much cleaner looking skin. Powered with the efficacies of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) and Bio Energy ingredients, it improves skin metabolism for firmer skin while lightening pigmentation at the same time. * Thoroughly and effectively removes dead skin cells * Gently and painlessly removes blackheads and lightens pimples * No need for squeezing or pore strips to remove blackheads, whiteheads and pimples * Helps to control shine, leaving skin refined and revitalised * Removes layers of dead skin cells while providing essential nutrients to skin</p>

It accelerates skin healing process and gives the skin sufficient hydration to improve on skin roughness. Bio-essence Bio-spring Water contains high trace minerals which are the perfect, natural treatment to obtain optimum skin care health. While minerals are vital in modern skin care, higher mineral content releases more energy and heat which will be drying to the skin.<br />

 <strong>Want to know the secret behind a confident and beautiful smile? Secret lies in Darlie&rsquo;s All Shiny White Toothpaste! Singapore No.1 Whitening Toothpaste to bring you the smile that you have always desire!</strong><br />
 <br />
 While most of us would take great care of our faces and bodies, treating ourselves to regular facials and massages, how many of us actually make conscious effort to take care of our teeth? Other than having shiny white teeth, good oral hygiene may also help to prevent or delay tooth erosion.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Tooth erosion affects the entire surface of the tooth. In time, tooth erosion can cause thinned enamel, and eventually can expose the softer dentine underneath the enamel. The enamel is a tissue covering the surface of the tooth crown and is the hardest, most highly mineralized substance in the human body. Functional enamel helps to absorb pressure of biting and chewing, protects the teeth inner structure and is essential for a beautiful smile. Dentine is sensitive so erosion can lead to your teeth being more sensitive to hot, cold or sweet foods and drinks.<br />
 Darlie, Singapore&rsquo;s leading and trusted dental care brand, introduces an uniquely formulated toothpaste:&nbsp;Darlie All Shiny White Enamel Care Toothpaste to counter the above problems!</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Its multi-benefit formula combines whitening power and enamel protection to strengthen teeth through re-mineralisation while 50 million of SWA (Speedy Whitening Agent) whitening molecules work to remove stubborn stains effectively. Be ready for healthy enamel and a dazzling whiter smile in just 14 days!<br />
 The first of its multiple benefits, Darlie All Shiny White Enamel helps strengthen tooth enamel. Overtime, the consumption of acidic food and drinks such as wine, soda drinks, citrus fruits, may cause damage to the teeth enamel. The enamel eventually loses its hardness and smoothness due to demineralisation resulting in the loss of tooth shininess and an uneven and course surface.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Fluoride has been proven in studies to strength enamel against acid erosion and re-mineralises enamel surface. The new Darlie All Shiny White Enamel Care toothpaste contains a unique enamel care formula that is enhanced with 45% more enamel strengthening ingredient*, Fluoride, which speed up the re-mineralisation of the enamel process as it restores surface smoothness of the teeth.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Like diamonds in the rough, our teeth need care for them to restore the shine and sparkle in your smile! Diamonds are a girl&rsquo;s best friend and so are your set of precious teeth! Start your day right with Darlie All Shiny White Enamel Care and dazzle the world with a bright smile.</p>

	Dentiste is the only effective nighttime toothpaste. It controls oral bacteria effectively and gives fresh morning breath, which leads to good oral and body health. It has been researched and developed for better maintenance to retain the best quality of toothpaste for all oral problems.Dentiste&#39; active ingredients are as follows:XylitolA natural sweetener with great taste and unique dental benefits, bringing new value to sugar-free oral hygiene. Some of Xylitol&#39;s benefits include: Fights against bad breath, Inhibits plaque formation on teeth, Reduces tooth decay, Encourages demineralization of teeth. Xylitol is completely safe for all ages.&nbsp;CDX (Cyclodextrin Complex) The doughnut shaped molecules of CDX is the new and powerful anti-odor ingredient of Dentiste&rsquo; Nighttime Toothpaste. Consequently, odors like cigarette smoke, coffee, and nighttime breath are immediately recognized sealed off and washed away by the Cyclodextrin complex molecular structure.&nbsp;Stable Vitamin C Vitamin C is good for the gums. However, in general, we cannot mix Vitamin C into toothpaste, as Vitamin C is freely soluble in water. Dentiste&rsquo; Nighttime Toothpaste&rsquo;s unique technology makes it possible to envelop Vitamin C, which is easily destroyed, in a special base. Vitamin C, which facilitates the restoration of destroyed collagen fibers through its effect of aiding in collagen synthesis, will prevent periodontal disease and keep the gums healthy.&nbsp;Micronized Silica Complex This active fine grinding ingredient is clinically proven effective on soothing sensitive teeth. Unlike the regular silica compound, this safe and low abrasion formula helps protect tooth enamel while brushing teeth.&nbsp;14 Natural Extracts Clinically proven effective on soothing sensitive teeth &ndash; it consists of Eucalyptus, Fennel, Mentha, Catechu, Cinnamon, Commiphora, Glycyrrhiza, Ratanhia, Myrrhis, Sage, Clove, Salvia, Anise and Ginger. These ingredients collectively provide favorable aroma for good breath with the abilities to have antibacterial properties, even against bacteria that can cause cavities and gingivitis, fight sore throats, mouth ulcer, dental infections, night breath and gum disease.&nbsp;Why you need nighttime toothpaste?When we sleep saliva flows slower than during daytime. Anaerobic bacteria start increasing in numbers and smelly Sulphur compounds are quickly formed resulting to Bad Morning Breath!&nbsp;Who should use Dentiste&rsquo; Nighttime Toothpaste?Whilst Dentiste&rsquo; Nighttime Toothpaste is suitable for people suffering from bad morning breath it is also for people who want to get healthier, since oral bacteria not only cause bad breath, it can easily induce lots of diseases as well. IMPORTANT NOTE TO DENTISTE TOOTHPASTE USERS: It is important to know that Dentist Nighttime Toothpaste is not as foamy as normal toothpastes for the simple reason that &ldquo;massive foam/bubbles&rdquo; are created from ingredients that are harsh and unhealthy for your gums and teeth.

 <strong>Optimal moisturisation even in deeper epidermal skin layers.</strong><br />
 Because moisture is what skin needs most, the Eucerin Aquaporin Active range was especially developed to optimally distribute it in the skin.Its refreshing and fast-absorbing texture provides the skin with intense and long-lasting moisture.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 <strong>Benefit: </strong><br />
 The refreshing and fast-absorbing texture provides normal to combination skin with intense and long-lasting moisture - even in deeper epidermal skin layers. The skin instantly feels soft, supple &amp; fresh and stays so over time. The innovation: Aquaporins are natural channels located in the cell membranes. By enabling water to flow into and out of the cells they help regulate the distribution of moisture in the epidermal skin layers. After years of research Eucerin has now developed AQUAporin ACTIVE, based on nature-identical Gluco-Glycerol that supports this natural network (in-vitro / ex-vivo). Moisture is optimally distributed even in deeper epidermal skin layers - long-lastingly. The result: Your skin is provided with intense moisture, even in deeper epidermal skin layers It instantly feels soft, supple &amp; fresh and stays so over time Active Ingredients: With nature-identical Gluco-Glycerol: This ingredient activates the skin&#39;s natural moisture network by creating new aquaporins. Aquaporins regulate the moisture flow into and out of the cells, thus ensuring an optimal moisture distribution in the different epidermal layers.</p>

The latest optical diffusers, including blue pearl, counter imperfections to immediately blur and smooth the look of lines.

	Tri-Aktiline Instant Deep Wrinkle Filler is a targeted deep-wrinkle filler clinically proven to fill in the look of fine lines, lift, firm and hydrate instantly, while boosting skin&rsquo;s natural collagen production over time. This innovative concentrate helps eliminate the appearance of wrinkles on contact, evening out and smoothing away the look of the deepest, most visible lines. Use it right where you need it most &ndash; on crow&rsquo;s feet, laugh lines, anywhere facial expressions have left their mark.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The core of Tri-Aktiline is a high-tech cocktail of three ingredients that help firm and plump skin&rsquo;s appearance over time.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Gatuline&reg; Expression :</strong> extracted from the South American Acmella Oleraca plant, helps relax the look of facial tension and expression lines, like crow&rsquo;s feet.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Kombuchka&trade; PH Extract, </strong>derived from sweet black tea, works to plump wrinkles to appear smoother on the surface.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Argireline&reg;, or acetyl hexapeptide-3, </strong>helps prompt skin into its re-build mode, boosting natural collagen production for long-term visible wrinkle reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This remarkably innovative formula provides immediate smoothing capabilities. Matte silicones instantly fill in creases on the skin&rsquo;s surface, temporarily veiling them, while sodium hyaluronate (a humectant), avocado oil, cholesterol and shea butter hydrate the skin to further plump fine lines all over the face. A silky blend of optical diffusers (ultra-light spherical powders) help eliminate the appearance of wrinkles on contact 
</p>

Outdoor activity over a long period of time; at the seaside or on the snow land - SPF 45- 50 PA+++; Make a supplement in every 1~2 hours Many more layers of sun-block will not necessarily result in better effect.

 Because of the slow metabolism for this skin type, making the structure of epidermal cells irregular and disorganized and in return the excess sebum secretion make the old and dead skin cells stick up on the skin surface, leading to the poor absorption ability. If no remedial action is taken, even thousands bottles of precious skincare products are being used, the result of anti-aging protection would be limited.<br />

	Chemical interference can damage hair. In permed hair the cystine-disulphide bond is split. At the end, when the hair has been re-formed the bond is closed again, but there is a permanent change in the keratin composition. Dyeing hair blond is based on an oxidizing destruction of the natural color pigments. Usually synthetic substances are used to color and depending on the formula they penetrate deeper into the hair and combine with the keratin. If hair isn&rsquo;t looked after carefully it will dry out, look dull and lifeless and can break and split.</p>

	Dry and brittle hair easily appears straw-like and dull. This is due to a hypofunction of the sebaceous glands where not enough sebum reaches the scalp to supply the hair with an adequate protective layer of lipids. There is a lack of protective, conditioning oily corpuscles, which keep the hair smooth, supple and glossy. The causes for this appearance could be the use of too strong oil-removing products, sun, wind, too hot hair-dryer, hormonal fluctuations, an unbalanced diet or even a low fat diet. This type of hair is often found in people with naturally curly hair.</p>

 Normally dry skin is also sensitive.&nbsp; Dryness can range from mild to severe, which can affect any part of the body.&nbsp; The most common symptom is itching, which can be mildly annoying to severely intense, often disturbing sleep.&nbsp;<br />

 <br />
 Sensitive skin is commonly dry and prone to allergic reactions but sensitive skin is not the same as allergic skin.&nbsp; Sensitive skin may react to the product only in the area of application while allergic skin reacts with the whole body.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Sensitive skin has fewer defense mechanisms to deal with stress factors, making it more fragile and vulnerable to irritation, roughness and extreme dryness.<br />

 <strong>The following factors can render skin drying out and sensitive skin: </strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Allergy</li>
 <li>
  Aggressive skin cleansing</li>
 <li>

 <li>

	<strong>&ldquo;8 of 10 TES Users noticed brighter, more supple skin within 7 sessions*&rdquo;</strong><br />
	<br />
	Time Essence Serum (TES) features encapsulated technology from<br />
	Japan. This allows our freshest active ingredients to reach your skin in its purest form.<br />
	This revolutionary capsule is engineering by harvesting pectin from botanical extracts,<br />
	much like the protective layer around fresh fruits, to prevent oxidization and<br />
	deterioration of the serum compound within.<br />
	<br />
	To activate ingredients within the Time Essence Serum Capsule, just select a few<br />
	capsules and crush them before application. Use as often as required, but for best<br />
	results, as part of SkinPerfect&rsquo;s SkinSaver Solution.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Bigger Capsules. More Essence.</strong><br />
	In the case of TES, size does matter. Our larger than average capsule size allow much<br />
	more active ingredients to reach your skin, optimizing every application. TES contains<br />
	33 ingredients, some of which are:<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Jojoba Seed Oil: Natural Moisturiser</strong><br />
	Retards water loss to enhance skin flexibility and suppleness. Jojoba is completely<br />
	miscible with the natural sebum of the skin, and when used on the skin forms a very thin,<br />
	non-greasy lipoid layer. This layer is partially porous and provides exceptional trans-<br />
	epidermal respiration and moisture control.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Astaxanthin: Powerful Anti-Oxidant</strong><br />
	Produced by algae in a specific response to combat UV-induced oxidative stress.<br />
	Astaxanthin has been shown to protect cells in vivo by reducing visible signs UV-aging<br />
	through both topical and dietary supplementation within 4 to 6 weeks of use. As part of<br />
	TES, it has an overall natural brightening effect on skin.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Ubiquinone: Anti-Wrinkle</strong><br />
	Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone) is a natural cell booster &ndash; it activates the production of<br />
	energy in cells, to revitalize cellular functions. This enhances the absorption of other<br />
	skincare products. Q10 slows down the visible signs of aging, for more youthful skin.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Chamomilla: Skin Soother</strong><br />
	Chamomile has an antiseptic and healing quality, which is effective in relieving skin<br />
	congestion. TES softens the skin with its carminative and healing effect along with its<br />
	natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Azulene, is also added which helps<br />
	to reduce puffiness and cleanse pore impurities.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Liquorice Root: Skin Tightening</strong><br />
	Liquorice Root has an anti-inflammatory effect and calms sensitivity, roughness and<br />
	skin irritation caused by allergies, inflamed pimples and sunburn.<br />
	<br />

	Bi-WHITE REVEAL Double Effectiveness: Fairness and Inner Radiance through Refine Skin Texture The NEW Bi-WHITE REVEAL range has superior whitening results and proven excellent tolerance on Asian skin. It is enriched with the following active ingredients: &bull;&nbsp; Ceramide White TM for its whitening effects and its ability to maintain and regulate the skin&#39;s barrier&#39;s permeability to water. It can also retain water. &bull;&nbsp; LHA that gently exfoliates dead cells and smoothes skin&#39;s texture by stimulating cell regeneration. It serves as a skin surface illuminator. &bull;&nbsp; Salicylic Acid helps slough off dead cells from the surface of the skin, leaving it smoother and softer. &bull;&nbsp; Vitamin CG for its whitening properties as a melanin blocker and surface exfoliation properties. &bull;&nbsp; Vitamin E is used for its anti-free radical properties and thus the protective effect it exerts against the free radicals released by keratinocytes. &nbsp; Clinically Proven Results on Asian Skin Based on a clinical test conducted on 40 Asian subjects under dermatological control over 8 weeks of use, the results are as follows: -&nbsp; A statistically significant lightening of the pigmentation after 8 weeks of use &ndash;14% -&nbsp; A statistically significant decrease in spot size after 8 weeks of use &ndash; 17% - A statistically significant decrease in the number of spots after 8 weeks of use- A water-in-oil emulsion that gives an immediate &ldquo;soft focus&rdquo; effect and smoothes complexion. &nbsp; Texture: Creamy, fresh fluid with a matt, non-sticky finish that leaves the skin feeling more supple.
